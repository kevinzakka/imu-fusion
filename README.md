# learn-filters

The goal of this repo is to get familiar with filters in the context of state estimation (e.g. sensor fusion). I'm going to be implementing the following filters:

* Kalman Filter
* Extended Kalman Filter
* Extended Kalman Filter (with autodiff)
* Unscented Kalman Filter
* Histogram Filter
* Particle Filter
