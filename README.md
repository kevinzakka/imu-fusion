# imu-fusion

The goal of this repo is to implement IMU sensor fusion in simulation and on real hardware using an Arduino.

## Todos

- [x] Implement 2 integrators: Euler's and 4th-order Runge-Kutta.
- [x] Implement various state classes.
- [ ] Create 3 sensor classes: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
- [ ] Implement a Kalman Filter and an EKF.
- [ ] Create a linear state estimation problem and apply the Kalman filter to it.
